/**
 * A "struct" that in practice describes a "variable" that can be
 * modified by the ExplorationExploitationAdapation class. There are always 3 possible actions:
 * <ul>
 *     <li> Randomization</li>
 *     <li> Imitation</li>
 *     <li> Exploitation</li>
 * </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  Probabilities are sequential but only one action is ever taken. So if the probabilities of exploration and imitation
 *  are both at 70% then there is a 70% of exploring and a (.3)(.7) probability of imitating. Failing both the agent will
 *  exploit
